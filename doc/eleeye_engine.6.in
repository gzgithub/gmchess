eleeye_engine is a command-line client for UCCI (based on \fIUCI\fP) protocol. It
provides full support of basic \fIUCI\fP \fIcommand\fP, such as \fIposition\fP, \fIgo\fP, banmoves or
bestmove and much more.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Universal Chess Interface (\fIUCI\fP) is an open communication protocol that
enables a chess program engine to communicate with its user interface.
.PP
It was designed and released by Rudolf Huber and Stefan Meyer-Kahlen, the
author of Shredder, in November 2000, and can be seen as a rival to the older
XBoard/WinBoard Communication protocol. Like the latter, it is free to use
without license fees.
.PP
Customarily, \fIUCI\fP assigns some tasks to the user interface that have
traditionally been handled by the engine itself. Most notably, the opening book
is usually expected to be handled by the interface, by simply selecting moves
to play until it is out of book, and only then starting up the engine for
calculation in the resulting \fIposition\fP. (\fIUCI\fP does not specify any on-disk format
for the opening book; different UIs -- user interfaces -- usually have their own,
proprietary formats.) Also, the user interface may handle endgame tablebases if
the engine does not support it itself, although this is often better handled in
the engine, as having tablebase information can be useful to consider a
possible future \fIposition\fP.
